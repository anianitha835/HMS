# <b>Hospital Management System</b>

The Hospital Management System Project is primarily concerned with handling medical records inside the hospital. 

More specifically, the system aids in the management of medical reports. The system also shows all of the personnel and patients who are available. It also enables the insertion of medication information and stocks. 

This project consists of two modes:<br>
<b>Doctor/Employee Panel</b><br>
<b>Admin Panel</b>

A doctor can easily access the system by entering their <i>doctor ID</i> and <i>password</i>. He or she is capable of managing patient, pharmacy, and lab records. The worker or doctor can also view and control inventories. 

The user can access each patient's detailed information and reports using it, according to the system. The users can also change their profiles.
